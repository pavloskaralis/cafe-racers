Purpose: Café Racers is a live-update typing game where 2 players race to copy a randomly generated text block. The app is café themed, displaying each user’s progress via a coffee cup being sipped. Players can also view a display of their current WPM typing speed, and have access to an AI mode with 3 difficulty settings. 

Technologies: Vue, Vue Router, Vuex, Laravel, MySQL, Pusher, JWT, SCSS

Backend Overview:  The game’s backend is created with PHP using Laravel as the framework. Given that the client must update in real time for its 2 player mode, Pusher is employed as a third party websocket library. When a user first visits the site, a get request containing any existing JWT within its header is sent to the server for authentication. If no such token exists, or if the token is invalid, the server generates an identification number and passes it back to the client within the payload of a new JWT. In the absence of user accounts, this is how the website recognizes different connecting clients. While the versus AI mode does not communicate with the backend, clicking 2 player mode sends a post request to the server, which in return responds with the id of the newly created game. The client then redirects the user to a unique link containing this id, and uses it to render the page via another get request to the server. As the game progresses, a user’s correct input initiates put requests to update the database, consequentially triggering channel events that repopulate their opponent’s client data. Finally, when both users decide to return to the lobby, a delete request is sent out during the destroy phase of the component lifecycle. 

Frontend Overview: The frontend of the application is created with Vue, Vuex, and Vue Router. In total, 9 components are employed to carry out the game’s logic, beginning with App.vue. Whenever a user visits the sites, this component dispatches an action to check for and store a JWT containing that user’s identification in its payload. From there, the Home component is loaded and displays a choice for either 2 player or versus AI mode. Either link renders the Game component (café background), though depending on the specific route, the Versus AI or Two Player component is initiated. Both of these structures contain the exact same sub-components, the key difference being the logic by which they’re rendered. The Keyboard component simply serves as a conditional virtual keyboard for any mobile user, while the Cup and Letter components represent actual game pieces. The Cup component is passed a computed object property that specifies its position (left or right), the associated player (this.userIs), their computed typing speed, and their computed completion rate. As these properties change, so does the view of the cup. In a similar fashion, the Letter component takes in a computed status that designates it as either being completed, current, or active depending on how far along the user is. Conclusively, a user’s progress is tracked by binding the TwoPlayer component’s keydown event with a trackInput method. Within this function, the event key is compared against the current letter. If it matches, the letter is marked as completed, passing the current status to the next character. Otherwise, it is flagged as a mistake and changes the background from blue to red.
